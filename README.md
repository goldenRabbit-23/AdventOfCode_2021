## 📅 Daily Overview

| Day | Title | Summary |
|-----|-------|---------|
| 01  | Sonar Sweep | Count the number of increases, both for individual values and for sums computed using a three-value sliding window. |
| 02  | Dive! | Calculate the submarine’s horizontal position and depth, including the aim. |
| 03  | Binary Diagnostic | Determine the most common and least common bit at each position across a set of binary numbers. |
| 04  | Giant Squid | Determine the bingo board that wins first and the one that wins last as numbers are called in a given order. |
| 05  | Hydrothermal Venture | Determine how many line segments overlap within a specific grid cell. |
| 06  | Lanternfish | Calculate the total number of lanternfish after 80 days and 256 days of reproduction. |
| 07  | The Treachery of Whales | Find the alignment position that minimizes the total fuel required for all crabs to move to the same location. |
| 08  | Seven Segment Search | Identify the correct wiring configuration for a seven-segment display. |
| 09  | Smoke Basin | Identify the low points and basins in the given cave heightmap. |
| 10  | Syntax Scoring | Compute error scores for corrupted syntax and completion scores for incomplete syntax. |
| 11  | Dumbo Octopus | Simulate the flashing octopuses, counting the total number of flashes and identifying the first step when all octopuses flash simultaneously. |
| 12  | Passage Pathing | Count distinct paths from `start` to `end` where either no small cave is visited more than once, or exactly one small cave may be visited twice. |
| 13  | Transparent Origami | Fold the transparent paper along the given lines, tracking how dots overlap after each fold, then read the final dot pattern to reveal the 8-capital-letter code. |
| 14  | Extended Polymerization | Apply pair-insertion rules to the given polymer template, and identify the most and least common elements after 10 and 40 steps. |
| 15  | Chiton | Find the lowest-risk path across a chiton grid, on both the original map and its five-times expansion. |
| 16  | Packet Decoder | Decode the hexadecimal packet using the given rules, then report the sum of all packet version numbers and the final value the packet evaluates to. |
| 17  | Trick Shot | Determine the highest `y` position the probe launcher can reach while hitting the target, and the distinct initial velocity values that allow it to hit the target. |
| 18  | Snailfish | Compute the magnitude of the fully reduced sum of all snailfish numbers, and find the maximum magnitude achievable by adding any two distinct snailfish numbers. |
| 19  | Beacon Scanner | Align multiple 3D scanners by finding overlapping beacon sets under unknown rotations and translations to build a single unified map. |
| 20  | Trench Map | Process the image using the given enhancement algorithm, and beware of background inversion. |
| 21  | Dirac Dice | Simulate the game played with a deterministic die, and simulate the entire universe of possibilities when rolling a three-sided quantum die. |
| 22  | Reactor Reboot | Count the total number of cubes that are on after following a series of reboot steps. |
| 23  |       |         |
| 24  |       |         |
| 25  |       |         |
